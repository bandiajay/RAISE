Overall, you are doing a good job in engaging in the conversation and asking relevant questions. However, there are a few areas for improvement. 

Firstly, make sure to speak clearly and avoid mixing up words (e.g. "pole station" instead of "police station"). This will help ensure smooth communication. 

Additionally, try to stay on topic and avoid jumping between different subjects too quickly. It can make the conversation hard to follow. 

Lastly, it's important to actively listen to the other person's responses and show genuine interest in what they are saying. This will help build rapport and make the conversation more engaging. 

Overall, keep practicing and working on your communication skills to become a more effective conversationalist.
