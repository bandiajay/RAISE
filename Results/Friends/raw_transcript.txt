I have chosen to make a traditional English Tretel. Wow, that sounds great. And what do you make of Monica? You know, okay, so Rachel's dessert is so good that I eat all of it. You have nothing? Nothing? Well, it's pretty, I trust you. So if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert? You're not going to mess it up. Wow, Monica, I love that. You really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question. How do you know when the butter is done? Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that. Rachel, you're killing us here. We have served the dessert already. There's drunken dancers awaiting. Oh, look at it, isn't it beautiful? Yeah, what is it? It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of lady fingers, then a layer of jam, then custard. Which I make from scratch. Then grassberries, more lady fingers.
