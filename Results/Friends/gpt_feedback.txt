Great job on engaging in the conversation and keeping it light and fun. You did a good job of staying in the moment and responding to the other person's comments. One area for improvement could be to ask more open-ended questions to keep the conversation flowing and allow the other person to share more about themselves. Overall, well done! Keep up the good work.
