Hey, what's everyone up for up to this weekend? Not much just relaxing. Why got any plans? Same here. What do you have in mind? How about a road trip to the beach? We could leave Saturday morning and come back Sunday evening. A beach trip that sounds amazing. I am in which beach are we thinking of? Allow that idea. Maybe we could go to the blue water beach. We would be about 4 hours drive from here. Blue water beach sound perfect. It has great spots for camping and one fights too. I have never been there but I have heard it's beautiful. Are we staying overnight? Yeah, I think we should camp overnight. I can bring the 10 tents, ripping bags. I will bring food and everything. Bye.
