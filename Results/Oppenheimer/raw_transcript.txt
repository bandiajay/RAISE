And you know this how? It's been done before. Ocean. Never in a lake, but in theory it should work the same. In theory. Theory created the atom bomb. What if it doesn't work? Then we can all sleep better at night knowing we at least tried, Spencer, and we become the richest people on the unemployment line. So let me get this straight. You want me to get back in that water and swim to the bottom of the lake and plant some sort of bomb? That's going to kill all these sharks in one bell swoop. Yeah. And forgetting everything else, which we can't. Whatever it is that other wildlife in that water. Collateral damage. We just need the lake, Spencer. Okay, if nothing else survives this, we're prepared to move forward knowing that. Okay, stop sitting on your ass here. I wouldn't be down here asking for your help if I had any other option.
