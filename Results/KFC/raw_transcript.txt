Okay, let me check my schedule one more time. Okay. And guess what? I am free that evening. Super. And how about oneita? Let me ask her. Yes, she seems to be free too. Great. Can we meet at 7pm? Yes. Where shall we meet? How about KFC? KFC? I'm just joking. Actually, I'm making reservations at the Chateau de Mille. Isn't that an expensive French restaurant? It is too bad.
