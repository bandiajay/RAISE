Overall, you did a great job of confirming availability and making plans with the other person. However, the joke about meeting at KFC may have come across as slightly dismissive or insensitive. It's important to be considerate of the other person's preferences and tastes when making plans. Additionally, mentioning the expensive nature of the restaurant may make the other person feel uncomfortable or pressured. It's best to focus on the excitement of trying a new restaurant together rather than the cost. Overall, great job on organizing the meeting and being flexible with the plans!
